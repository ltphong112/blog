[{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a comprehensive guide on how to install Hugo, set up Git, and host a static website with Cloudflare, including the advantages of using Cloudflare and static websites.\nAdvantages of Hosting on Cloudflare\nPerformance: Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s global Content Delivery Network (CDN) ensures your website loads quickly from anywhere in the world. Security: Cloudflare provides robust security features, including DDoS protection, a Web Application Firewall (WAF), and free SSL certificates. Reliability: Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s Always Online feature keeps a cached version of your site available even if your server goes down. Why Static Websites are Better than Dynamic\nSpeed: Static websites load faster because they serve pre-built HTML files, unlike dynamic websites that generate content on the fly. Security: Static sites are less vulnerable to attacks since they don\u0026rsquo;t rely on server-side processing. Cost-Effective: Hosting static sites is generally cheaper as they require less server resources. Introduction to Hugo\nHugo is a fast and flexible static site generator written in Go. It allows you to create static websites quickly and efficiently, using Markdown for content and a variety of themes for design.\nStep-by-Step Guide Install Hugo\nWindows: Use Chocolatey: choco install hugo-extended macOS: Use Homebrew: brew install hugo Linux: Use your package manager, e.g., sudo apt-get install hugo for Ubuntu. Set Up Git and Sync Content Install Git:\nWindows: Download and install from Git for Windows. macOS: Install via Homebrew: brew install git. Linux: Use your package manager, e.g., sudo apt-get install git for Ubuntu. Configure Git:\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;your.email@example.com\u0026#34; Initialize a Git Repository:\ncd your-hugo-site git init git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git git push -u origin master Set Up Cloudflare to Work with Hugo Create a Cloudflare Account: Sign up at Cloudflare.\nAdd Your Site to Cloudflare:\nGo to the Cloudflare dashboard and add your site. Update your domain\u0026rsquo;s nameservers to point to Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s nameservers. Deploy Hugo Site to Cloudflare Pages:\nGo to the Pages section in Cloudflare. Click \u0026ldquo;Create a project\u0026rdquo; and connect your GitHub repository. Configure the build settings: set the build command to hugo and the output directory to public. Use a Custom Domain Add Custom Domain in Cloudflare:\nIn the Cloudflare Pages dashboard, go to your project settings and add your custom domain. Update your DNS settings to point your custom domain to the Cloudflare Pages domain. Configure SSL/TLS:\nCloudflare provides SSL/TLS encryption by default. You can configure SSL settings in the Cloudflare dashboard under the SSL/TLS tab. Conclusion By following these steps, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a fast, secure, and reliable static website hosted on Cloudflare using Hugo. This setup leverages the advantages of static sites and Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s robust features to ensure optimal performance and security.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/static-website-with-hugo-and-cloudflare/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s a comprehensive guide on how to install Hugo, set up Git, and host a static website with Cloudflare, including the advantages of using Cloudflare and static websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdvantages of Hosting on Cloudflare\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePerformance: Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s global Content Delivery Network (CDN) ensures your website loads quickly from anywhere in the world.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecurity: Cloudflare provides robust security features, including DDoS protection, a Web Application Firewall (WAF), and free SSL certificates.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReliability: Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s Always Online feature keeps a cached version of your site available even if your server goes down.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Static Websites are Better than Dynamic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Static Website With Hugo and Cloudflare"},{"content":"Here are the steps to install WordPress under Docker, including setting up a directory for file backups and adding an uploads.ini file to customize PHP settings.\nStep 1: Create a Directory for Your Project Open a terminal and create a directory for your WordPress project:\nmkdir wordpress-docker cd wordpress-docker Step 2: Create a docker-compose.yml File Create a docker-compose.yml file in the wordpress-docker directory with the following content:\nversion: \u0026#39;3.8\u0026#39; # Specifies the Docker Compose file format version services: wordpress: image: wordpress:latest container_name: wordpress ports: - \u0026#34;8000:80\u0026#34; volumes: - ./html:/var/www/html - ./uploads.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/uploads.ini environment: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress restart: unless-stopped db: image: mariadb:latest container_name: wordpress_db volumes: - db_data:/var/lib/mysql environment: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somewordpress MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress MYSQL_USER: wordpress MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress restart: unless-stopped volumes: db_data: Step 3: Create the uploads.ini File Create an uploads.ini file in the wordpress-docker directory with the following content:\nfile_uploads = On memory_limit = 64M upload_max_filesize = 64M post_max_size = 64M max_execution_time = 600 Step 4: Start the Docker Containers Run the following command to start the Docker containers:\ndocker-compose up -d Step 5: Access Your WordPress Site Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to complete the WordPress installation.\nStep 6: Backup Your Files Ensure that your WordPress files are backed up by mapping the ./html directory to /var/www/html in the Docker container.

This manual will guide you through the installation process of Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel using Docker with host network mode and a Cloudflare Token for authentication.\nStep 1: Log in to Cloudflare and Create a Tunnel Configuration\nOpen a web browser and navigate to the Cloudflare website. Log in to your Cloudflare account. Go to the \u0026ldquo;Zero Trust\u0026rdquo; section in the Cloudflare dashboard. Click on \u0026ldquo;Tunnels\u0026rdquo; and then \u0026ldquo;Create Tunnel Configuration.\u0026rdquo; Provide a name for your configuration, select the data centers you want to use, and configure other settings as per your requirements. Save the configuration. Step 2: Start the Tunnel Container with Docker\nOpen a terminal or command prompt. Run the following command to start the Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel container using host network mode and the Cloudflare Token: sudo docker run -d --name cloudflare --restart unless-stopped --network host cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token \u0026lt;cloudflare_token\u0026gt; Replace \u0026lt;cloudflare_token\u0026gt; with the Cloudflare Token you generated in Step 1.

If the tunnel is functioning correctly, you will see a success message indicating that your tunnel is working. Test accessing your private resources through the tunnel to ensure connectivity and proper functionality.
