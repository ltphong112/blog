[{"content":"Introduction: Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel is a secure solution that enables you to connect your private infrastructure to Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s network without exposing it to the public internet. This manual will guide you through the installation process of Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel using Docker with host network mode and a Cloudflare Token for authentication.\nStep 1: Log in to Cloudflare and Create a Tunnel Configuration\nOpen a web browser and navigate to the Cloudflare website. Log in to your Cloudflare account. Go to the \u0026ldquo;Zero Trust\u0026rdquo; section in the Cloudflare dashboard. Click on \u0026ldquo;Tunnels\u0026rdquo; and then \u0026ldquo;Create Tunnel Configuration.\u0026rdquo; Provide a name for your configuration, select the data centers you want to use, and configure other settings as per your requirements. Save the configuration. Step 2: Start the Tunnel Container with Docker\nOpen a terminal or command prompt. Run the following command to start the Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel container using host network mode and the Cloudflare Token: sudo docker run -d --name cloudflare --restart unless-stopped --network host cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token \u0026lt;cloudflare_token\u0026gt; Replace \u0026lt;cloudflare_token\u0026gt; with the Cloudflare Token you generated in Step 1. Example:\nsudo docker run -d --name cloudflare --restart unless-stopped --network host cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token eyJhIjoiM2U1Yzg1NWExOWE3MGE3N2YwMzY1ZWNjZDVlMzlhOTgiLCJ0IjoiYTY4OTdmMWQtYjFhOC00MjExLWIxZTQtZmJmOTA3YmRmMGZmIiwicyI6Ik5qUXdNalZrWTJJdFlUZzROQzAwTkRGa0xUZzFPVFV0T0RZek9Ea3lPV1F6WldaaSJ9 Step 3: Validate and Test the Tunnel\nCheck the logs of the Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel container to ensure that it started successfully: sudo docker logs cloudflare You should see logs indicating a successful connection to Cloudflare.\nOpen a web browser and visit the URL provided by Cloudflare during the tunnel creation. If the tunnel is functioning correctly, you will see a success message indicating that your tunnel is working. Test accessing your private resources through the tunnel to ensure connectivity and proper functionality. Step 4: Run Cloudflared as a Daemon Service (optional) If you want to run Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel as a daemon service, you can use Docker\u0026rsquo;s daemon mode and enable automatic restart. Example:\nsudo docker run -d --name cloudflare --restart unless-stopped --network host cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token eyJhIjoiM2U1Yzg1NWExOWE3MGE3N2YwMzY1ZWNjZDVlMzlh ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/install-cloudflare-zero-trust-with-docker/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIntroduction:\nCloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel is a secure solution that enables you to connect your private infrastructure to Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s network without exposing it to the public internet.

If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have these tools installed, you can follow the instructions provided by Docker to install them on your system.\nOnce you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can use the following steps to install Jellyfin using Docker Compose:\nCreate a new directory for your Jellyfin installation, and navigate to that directory in your terminal. Create a new file called docker-compose.yml in your Jellyfin directory, and add the following contents to the file:\nversion: \u0026#39;3.7\u0026#39; services: jellyfin: image: jellyfin/jellyfin container_name: jellyfin restart: always ports: - 8096:8096 - 8920:8920 volumes: - /path/to/your/config:/config - /path/to/your/media:/media environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Your/Timezone - UMASK_SET=022 Replace /path/to/your/config and /path/to/your/media with the actual paths on your system where you want to store your Jellyfin configuration and media files, respectively. Replace Your/Timezone with your actual timezone (e.g., \u0026ldquo;America/New_York\u0026rdquo;). Save the docker-compose.yml file and close it. Run the following command to start Jellyfin using Docker Compose:\ndocker-compose up -d This will download the Jellyfin Docker image and start a new Jellyfin container using the configuration specified in your docker-compose.yml file.\nOnce the container is running, you can access the Jellyfin web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8096. That\u0026rsquo;s it! You should now have a working Jellyfin installation running in a Docker container on your system.\nNote: The above instructions are just a basic example of how to install Jellyfin using Docker Compose. There are many other options and configurations that you can specify in your docker-compose.yml file to customize your Jellyfin installation.
