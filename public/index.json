Create a new file called docker-compose.yml in your Jellyfin directory, and add the following contents to the file:\nversion: \u0026#39;3.7\u0026#39; services: jellyfin: image: jellyfin/jellyfin container_name: jellyfin restart: always ports: - 8096:8096 - 8920:8920 volumes: - /path/to/your/config:/config - /path/to/your/media:/media environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Your/Timezone - UMASK_SET=022 Replace /path/to/your/config and /path/to/your/media with the actual paths on your system where you want to store your Jellyfin configuration and media files, respectively. Replace Your/Timezone with your actual timezone (e.g., \u0026ldquo;America/New_York\u0026rdquo;). Save the docker-compose.yml file and close it. Run the following command to start Jellyfin using Docker Compose:\ndocker-compose up -d This will download the Jellyfin Docker image and start a new Jellyfin container using the configuration specified in your docker-compose.yml file.\nOnce the container is running, you can access the Jellyfin web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8096. That\u0026rsquo;s it! You should now have a working Jellyfin installation running in a Docker container on your system.\nNote: The above instructions are just a basic example of how to install Jellyfin using Docker Compose. There are many other options and configurations that you can specify in your docker-compose.yml file to customize your Jellyfin installation. For more information, you can refer to the Jellyfin documentation and the Docker Compose documentation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/install-jellyfin-with-docker-compose/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTo install Jellyfin using Docker Compose, you will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
